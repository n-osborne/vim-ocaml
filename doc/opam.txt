License: Same terms as Vim itself (see |license|)

This plugin is only available if 'compatible' is not set.

COMMANDS                                        *:opam*

:Opam                    With no argument. Refresh the environment using |opam env|.

:Opam {version}          Set the current switch to {version}.

CONFIGURATION                                    *opam-configuration*

                                                 *g:opam_set_switch*

If this variable is set to a non-zero value, |:Opam| will set the |$OPAMSWITCH|
environment variable. This variable will make sure that every |opam| commands
run from inside Vim will continue to act on the same switch even if the
selected switch is changed.
This also mean that selecting a different switch without using the |:Opam|
command will not take effect in this instance of Vim.
Defaults to |0|.

  let g:opam_set_switch = 1

                                                 *g:opam_init_env*

If this variable is set to a non-zero value, Opam's environment will be
refreshed when the plugin is loaded for the first time.
This is equivalent to calling |:Opam| when first opening an OCaml file.

  let g:opam_init_env = 1
